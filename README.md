# Project Name

Drum Kit



## Usage

I created an exciting web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app includes a special beat-making tool that users can interact with.
This tool features a keyboard that responds when you press keys and logo buttons that you can click on. 
These interactive elements make the experience more enjoyable for users.
